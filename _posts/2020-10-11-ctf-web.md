This challenge was quite straightforward. I pinged target.helsec.fi to get the IP address and then did a simple Nmap scan of it to acquire the open ports â€“ 22, 80 and 31337. Out of these three the 31337/tcp was the one that stuck out. Knowing the lighthearted nature of this challenge, that was indeed the correct answer, giving me the great start as a 31337 h4Xx0r.
